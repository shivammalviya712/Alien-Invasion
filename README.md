# Alien Invasion
I created this game by following the "Python Crash Course" book by Eric Matthes, to improve my Python skills. In this project I have used the Pygame package to develop a 2D game in which the aim is to shoot down a fleet of aliens as they drop down the screen in levels that increase in speed and difficulty. This is one of the favourite games of my childhood.
