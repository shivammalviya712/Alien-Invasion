# Alien Invasion

Objective: To improve my Python skills. 

This is one of the favourite games of my childhood. In this project I have used the Pygame package to develop a 2D game in which the aim is to shoot down a fleet of aliens as they drop down the screen, as the level increases in speed and difficulty also increases.
